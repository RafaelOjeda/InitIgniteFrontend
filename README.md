# Init Ignite Frontend

The website would aid with visibility of the program as it does not get as many eyeballs as it should. Every semester there has been a dropoff in enrollment of FIU students of about 25-30% since January 2024. With an increase of enrollment and visibility a informative site can be influential towards new K-12 teachers that are looking to be a part of the program.

## Running site
Required Node Modules
```
npm i typescript react-boostrap bootstrap swiper
```
Starting server
```
npm run dev
```

## MVP
- I am an admain for a semester and I should be able to assign teacher-students to K-12 teachers using the Airtable survey in order to double check the students schedule.
- I am a teacher-student and when I am assigned to a K-12 teacher I should be able to see their contact information as well as the other teacher-students that I will be working with
- Website should be mobile and desktop friendly
